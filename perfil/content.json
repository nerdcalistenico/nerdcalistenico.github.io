Ela foi adaptada e utilizada a partir da série de televisão japonesa Zyuranger, que foi a 16ª série Super Sentai da Toei Company.Tanto a série quanto a linha de produtos tornaram-se um grande êxito da noite para o dia, tornando-se um hit da década de 1990 e parte da cultura pop em poucos meses.A série original durou por três anos, entre 1993 e 1995 gerando consequentemente o filme Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie.A segunda e terceira temporadas da série foram baseadas em imagens e elementos das séries Super Sentais Gosei Sentai Dairanger e Ninja Sentai Kakuranger respectivamente, embora os costumes de Zyuranger ainda fossem usados ​​para o elenco principal.Somente o robô e o traje do Kiba Ranger (usado pelo Ranger Branco) e mais o robô formado pelos cinco “zords” foram retidos de Dairanger para a segunda temporada, enquanto apenas o robô de Kakuranger formado pelos cinco “zords” (fora o Shogunzords) foi destaque na terceira temporada. No entanto, os trajes de Kakuranger foram posteriormente utilizados para os personagens-título da minissérie, Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers.A série foi produzida pela Power Rangers Productions, distribuída pela Saban Entertainment e, foi ao ar na Fox Kids. A mercadoria do show foi produzida e distribuída pela Bandai Entertainment, chegando a vender $6 bilhões.Em 1996, a série foi rebatizada como a franquia Power Rangers, renomeando a série todos os anos depois, e usando figurinos, adereços e imagens da subsequente série Super Sentai, bem como alterando a linha de elenco e história. Enquanto uma linha de história global continuaria até Power Rangers: Lost Galaxy, as séries subseqüentes após Power Rangers não são continuações ou spin-offs no sentido tradicional.Em 2010 foi transmitida a reestréia de Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, com um novo logotipo, quadrinhos gráficos e imagem digitalizada com efeitos especiais alternativos extras, foi transmitida pela ABC Kids. A Bandai produziu novos brinquedos para coincidir com a série.O estúdio Lionsgate definiu uma data para um reboot em versão cinematográfica que chegou aos cinemas desde 23 de março de 2017 nos Brasil e no dia 24 nos EUA.HistóriaEm uma missão ao planeta Marte dois astronautas encontram uma estranha cápsula encostada no solo do planeta. Eles abrem e libertam a feiticeira espacial do mal Rita Repulsa.Ela não perde tempo e logo ataca o planeta Terra. Para proteger o planeta, o ser intergalático Zordon e seu assistente robô Alpha 5 recrutam os adolescentes Jason, Zack, Billy, Trini e Kimberly e dão os morfadores e as moedas do poder para se tornarem Power Rangers, um grupo de super heróis com arsenal de alta tecnologia e que possuem veículos gigantes de combates chamados zords. Após certa relutância, o grupo aceita a missão de lutar contra Rita e sua horda maligna.Para derrotar os Power Rangers de uma vez por todas, Rita cria o Ranger verde, enfeitiçando o adolescente Tommy e lhe concede um morfador e uma moeda do poder para eliminar seus inimigos.Mas Jason, o Ranger vermelho e líder da equipe consegue vencer Tommy em uma luta e quebra o feitiço, convencendo Tommy a se juntar a equipe. Depois de certo tempo, Tommy começou a perder os poderes, e após entregar sua moeda do poder a Jason, Rita lançou um mega ataque a Terra com o zord de guerra de seu general Goldar, mas acabou sendo derrotada mais uma vez. Logo, Zordon achou um meio de restaurar os poderes de Tommy, e o Ranger verde retorna para ajudar a equipe.https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mighty_Morphin_Power_Rangers Fonte: Wikipédia","pubDate":"Sat, 15 Aug 2020 19:20:00 GMT","guid":"https://nerdcalistenico.github.io/perfil/preferencias/tokusatsu/mighty-morphin-power-rangers/","category":"tokusatsu,nostalgia"},{"title":"Chespirito","link":"https://nerdcalistenico.github.io/perfil/preferencias/programas-infantis/chespirito/","description":"Título no Brasil: Clube do ChavesPrimeiro episódio: 15 de outubro de 1970 (1ª fase) - 4 de fevereiro de 1980 (2ª fase)Episódio final: 20 de fevereiro de 1973 (1ª fase) - 25 de setembro de 1995 (2ª fase)Número de temporadas: 16Emissora original: El Canal de las EstrellasNúmero de episódios: 692Elenco: Roberto Gómez Bolaños Chómpiras Rubén Aguirre Doctor María Antonieta de las Nieves La Chilindrina Angelines Fernández Doña Cleotilde Ramón Valdés Don Ramón Carlos Villagrán Quico Édgar Vivar Señor Barriga Florinda Meza Doña Florinda Horacio Gómez Bolaños Godínez Raúl (Chato) Padilla Señor JaimitoChespirito (também conhecido no Brasil como Clube do Chaves) foi um programa de televisão humorístico mexicano criado, roteirizado, dirigido e estrelado por Roberto Gómez Bolaños, mais conhecido pela alcunha que carregava o programa.Estreou originalmente, uma vez por semana, no horário nobre da Televisa. Este programa, porém, não apresenta todo o elenco da série Chaves: há dois atores ausentes no seriado: Ramón Valdés (intérprete do Seu Madruga) e Carlos Villagrán (intérprete do Quico). Embora, em 1981, Ramón Valdés volte a interpretar Seu Madruga no programa, no quadro Chaves, e Tripa Seca no quadro Chapolin Colorado (além de várias participações nos demais quadros), abandonou o elenco CH definitivamente no final do ano.O programa Chespirito teve também um primeiro período, de 15 de outubro de 1970 a 20 de fevereiro de 1973 (originalmente chamado Los supergenios de la mesa cuadrada), antes de Chaves e Chapolin tornarem-se programas independentes, sendo que neste período, Ramón Valdés e Carlos Villagrán faziam parte do Elenco CH.Grande parte dos episódios do primeiro período são perdidos, pois não são mais distribuídos pela televisa, entre eles estão a primeira aparição do chaves, do doutor Chapatin, primeiras versões perdidas de episódios clássicos. Alguns esquetes de 1970/1971 (com Chapolin, Chespirito, Chaparrón e doutor Chapatin) podem ser encontradas na internet retirados de acervos pessoais de fãs.Quarenta e quatro esquetes de 1972 foram compilados em episódios de Chaves e Chapolin já como programas próprios quando Chespirito não pode gravar e são distribuídos normalmente pela Televisa.
